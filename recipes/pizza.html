    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature for your pizza dough (usually around 450Â°F or as indicated on the dough packaging).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Pizza Dough:
            Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet that's been lightly greased or lined with parchment paper.
            </li>
        <li>Apply Alfredo Sauce:
            Spread a generous layer of Alfredo sauce evenly over the pizza dough. Leave a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Layer the Cheese:
            Sprinkle a layer of cheese (Mozzarella or your choice) over the Alfredo sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the Cooked Chicken:
            Distribute the cooked chicken evenly over the cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Add Veggies:
            Sprinkle the sliced black olives, paprika, sliced onions, and sliced mushrooms over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Seasoning:
            Optionally, you can add extra seasoning like dried oregano, basil, or red pepper flakes for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Bake:
            Carefully transfer the prepared pizza into the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake until Golden Brown:
            Bake the pizza in the oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Cool and Slice:
            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and Serve:
            Slice your Chicken & Veggies Pizza Alfredo into portions and serve it hot. Enjoy!</li>
